# Mixxx Stuff - Blue branch
Mixxx personnal controllers mappings :
  - Hercules DJ Control Air
  - Behringer CMD DC-1
  - Behringer CMD DV-1

This "blue" branch offers an alternative visual aspect of the CMD controllers,
which consists of a default LED color set to blue instead of the default orange/amber one.
It requires only a minor modification of the scripts as the code has been made for easy updates
and use global variables for the main parameters.
The mapping files (XML) requires more attention as there is a lot of entries to modify and it is
badly ordered by the Mixxx controller editor.
